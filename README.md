# Next.js Framework Starter

<!-- dash-content-start -->

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It's deployed on Cloudflare Workers as a [static website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/).

<!-- dash-content-end -->

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/royal-boat-e2b8
```

A live public deployment of this template is available at [https://royal-boat-e2b8.templates.workers.dev](https://royal-boat-e2b8.templates.workers.dev)

## Getting Started

First, run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then run the development server (using the package manager of your choice):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Creating a full-fledged blockchain crypto coin data analytic and mining system, integrated with wallets for Binance, Bitcoin, and Solana, is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, security, and programming. Below is a simplified version of how such a system might be structured using Python and some pseudocode. This example focuses on the key components you've mentioned:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: requests, hashlib, flask, sqlalchemy, etc.
Knowledge of blockchain APIs (e.g., Binance API, Bitcoin RPC, Solana API)
A secure environment for deploying your application
Basic Code Structure
Mining Functionality
Wallet Integration
Transaction Handling
High Security Protocols
User Interface
