Explanation:

The PaymentProcessor class is responsible for the secure payment processing and transfer of revenues to the developer's account.
The process_payment method is the main entry point for processing the payment. It first loads the payment policies, validates them, and then transfers the funds to the developer's account.
The _load_payment_policies method reads the payment policies from the specified directory and returns them as a dictionary.
The _validate_payment_policies method checks if all the required policies are present and validates the content of each policy. In this example, the _validate_international_money_transfer_policy method is implemented to validate the international money transfer policy.
The _transfer_funds method is responsible for the actual transfer of funds to the developer's account. This method may involve integrating with a payment gateway or banking API.
The main function sets up the revenue sources and creates an instance of the PaymentProcessor class to process the payment.
